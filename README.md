# AMRL-Meta-Net
Hyperparameter configuration remains a critical yet challenging issue in reinforcement learning, as effective settings depend on evolving training dynamics and task-specific characteristics. Most existing approaches rely on static, offline optimization or population-based strategies, which either fail to adapt during training or require substantial computational resources. From an expert systems perspective, hyperparameter control can be viewed as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty, where decisions should be continuously revised based on observed system feedback.
Adaptive Meta-Reinforcement Learning (AMRL), a resource-efficient adaptive expert decision framework for online hyperparameter control. AMRL adopts a dual-loop architecture in which a meta-level expert module, implemented as an LSTM-based meta-learner. By explicitly modeling hyperparameter adaptationas a sequential decision process, the proposed framework enables continuous, experience-driven adjustment using a single learning agent, without relying on population-based training or extensive parallel computation.
